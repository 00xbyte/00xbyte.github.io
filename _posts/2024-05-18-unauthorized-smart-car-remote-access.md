# Intro
As the entire world races torwards connectivity, time-to-market is often prioritized over security.  
In today's episode - finding vulnerabilities in smart car appliences!

> Improper authorization may lead to unauthorized access to smart car appliences (dash cams, car infotainment systems), granting access to location history, videos and more.

## Affected Vendors:
- Szime
- Proof.co.il

After several attempts to contact both vendors (on multiple channels) with no reply, I am publishing the details of this vulnerability so that users can protect themselves from vehicle surveillance.


# The vulnerability

## Intro to the system
When a customer buys a new device, they download the associated app and register their appliance to the app with a unique identifier called `IMEI`. This process is called device binding. **Once a user binds a camera to their phone, they have full controll over it and can access all of its features, including location history and videos.**

## Issue #1 - IMEI numbers are predictable
I have found that IMEI numbers are constructed from 14 digits where the first 13 digits are the identifier and the last digit is a checksum digit calculated by [the Luhn algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm).  
The problem is that the IMEI numbers are sequential.
If for example your car cam has the IMEI `01234567891233`, then there is a good chance that the previous IMEI `01234567891225` belongs to another camera.

There is also an API request to check if an IMEI exists:  
First, login to obtain an `access_token`
```
POST /oauth/token HTTP/1.1
...

grant_type=password&client_id=app&client_secret=api1234&scope=SCOPE_READ&username=xxxxxxxxxx&password=yyyyyyyyyy
```
(ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è lets take a second to appreciate this marvelous secret api key embedded in the client app: `api1234`)  
`username` being a phone number.

Then check if the IMEI exists:
```
GET /api/v2/user/sendbindreq?access_token=xxxxxxxxx&did=yyyyyyyyyyyyyy HTTP/1.1
...

```
`did` is the device id - aka IMEI.

This allows an attacker to brute-force their way to retreive all the existing IMEIs.
Because the camera has no way to validate the binding phone is the correct one, then:  
**Any user can register to themselves any unregistered camera by guessing the IMEI**

Futhermore, the IMEI number is visible on some devices (like dash cams) and allows pedestrians to look through the car window and obtain the IMEI number.

You will understand soon why this is a big issue.

## Issue #2 - 'Stealing' a binded camera
We have established that once a camera is binded to a phone, only they have access to its features.  
But what if an attacker was able to "steal" a camera by binding it to their phone? Unfortunately this is possible.  
I have found that the debind process is not properly authorized. Take a look:

If an attacker sends this "debind" request with the `imei` being the victim's device's IMEI:
```
POST /api/v2/user/debinddev?access_token=xxxxxxxxx HTTP/1.1
...

{"imei":"yyyyyyyyyyyyyy" }
```
There is no validation that the request initiator is the owner of the device and the device is unbinded immediately!  
This means **any user with an account can debind any device given its IMEI number!**

Next, all the attacker needs to do is bind the device to thier account with the following request:
```
POST /api/v2/user/binddev?access_token=xxxxxxxxx HTTP/1.1
...

{"name":"yyyyyyyyyy","imei":"zzzzzzzzzzzzzz", "nick":"notImportant"}
```
`name` being the phone number.

Thats it! The device is now binded to their account and they have access to all of the deivce's recorded data!


## Bonus Issue - Registration without phone validation
There is no validation the the registered phone number belongs to the user. No SMS, nothing.  
This issue makes these attacks easier because this removes the requirement for an active phone number and allows the whole attack to be executed from a script!
```
POST /api/v2/user/register HTTP/1.0
...

{"pn":"xxxxxxxxxx", "pwd":"yyyyyyyyyy"}
```
`pn` stands for phone number, and `pwd` for password


# Mitigation
Until the vendors fix this issue, I recommend that all users disconnect thier devices from the internet.

Proof.co.il and Szime.com, if you are reading this, please fix this issue and please stop ghosting security researchers.
